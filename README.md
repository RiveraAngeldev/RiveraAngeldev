# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Angel Rivera**, a Computer Engineering student based in Puerto Rico 🇵🇷.

I design and build whatever I can imagine.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I'll build it and ship it.

My main tech stack for logic and systems is **C++ and Java**, while for the web, I focus on creating polished and high-quality **Frontend** interfaces. 

I’m also expanding my horizons by studying **Artificial Intelligence with Python** to build smarter applications.

I’m always open to collaborations on software engineering projects, game dev, AI experiments, or any crazy idea you might have.
